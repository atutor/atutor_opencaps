MODULE DETAILS:
---------------
Module Name: AtOpenCaps
version: 1.0
License: GPL
Languages: English (en), Spanish (es-es)

AtOpenCaps is an Atutor's module; integrating Atutor with OpenCaps, 
an open source web-based captioning tool. 

This module loads media and caption files stored in Atutor's course content 
directory and manages all transactions needed to deliver and create caption 
files using OpenCaps web captioning editor. 

This module provides a modified version of the OpenCaps web captioning tool 
and it is located in the "opencaps" directory. However, for updates and future 
compatibility, you must check and download new version from the OpenCaps website.

This module also includes a version of FlowPlayer for previewing captioned projects.

***********************************
1. Installation
***********************************

***********************************
1.1. Setting Directory Permissions
***********************************
Open Caps requires reading and writing permissions in two directories: 

/ATutor/mods/AtOpenCaps/opencaps/projects
/ATutor/mods/AtOpenCaps/opencaps/conversion_service

Please set these permissions accordingly. 

***********************************
1.2. Un-installation Notes
***********************************
AtOpenCaps uses Atutor database to store matching-pairs of media and caption files. 
When removing AtOpenCaps module, the the administrator can decide whether to delete this database or not.

However, removing this module will NOT delete any media file or 
captions already stored in the course content directory. 

***********************************
1.3. Known Issues
***********************************
This module was developed at a moment when Atutor is expanding 
its compatibility with new media players and captioning media formats. 
At the same time, OpenCaps is currently developing new strategies for 
communicating with external systems. 

For this reasons, AtOpenCaps module presents the following known issues:

a) When OpenCaps is loaded for first time. An empty screen shows up. 
It is necessary to reload the page and then it will work.

b) Atutor content rendering class is not ready to display the adequate 
tags for flowplayer version flowplayer-3.2.2.swf. Proper handlers are 
needed to allow Atutor core code to load the following FlowPlayer plugins:

	- flowplayer.audio-3.2.0.swf
	- flowplayer.captions-3.2.1.swf
	- flowplayer.content-3.2.0.swf
	- flowplayer.content-3.2.0.swf

***********************************
2. Using AtOpenCaps
***********************************

***********************************
2.1. Uploading Media Files
***********************************
To upload a file click on the "Upload Media" tab. This will open Atutor's 
File Management utility and allow the user to upload files to the course 
content directory. For additional documentation about this utility, 
please review "Atutor HandBook": (http://help.atutor.ca/index/index.php).

***********************************
2.2. Creating Projects
***********************************
In order to create a new project, the user must first upload media 
files by clicking on the Upload Media tab. 

To Create a new caption Project, click on the "Add Project" tab. 
Then,  set a name of the project, select one of the available media 
files from the list, and select either to create an empty caption file 
or type the name of a caption file already uploaded to the course content.

The user can also specify the width and height of the media file. 
This will be use to set the adequate size when playing captioning projects. 
If not width or height are set, a default size will be used (320x240)

Note that if the user selects the option "Select An existing Caption", 
the name of the existing caption file must be typed manually. 
For example, "my_caption_file.srt"

***********************************
2.3. Start Captioning
***********************************
To start captioning, simply click on "My Caption Projects". 
Then, click on the name of the project. This will lunch Open Caps editing tool. 

Note: Once you have finished captioning, remember to click on the link "Finish".
Then, click on the button "Submit Captions to Atutor".  

***********************************
2.4. Playing Captioned Media
***********************************
To preview a captioning project, click on the "Preview" tab. 
Note that by clicking on this link the last project will be opened.

Finally, click on the image and the Flow player will be loaded 
using the corresponding media and caption file.

***********************************
3. The Future of This Module
***********************************
Although AtOpenCaps version 1.0 provides the basic communication 
between OpenCaps and Atutor, the ways in which captioning media can be 
played on the web is rapidly evolving. This means that there are many 
players out there capable of playing captioned media. 

The future development of this module will include compatibility with 
new players as well as a wide range of caption formats.
